# EZ-FIFOs with LWT

## Objectives

Cast informations easily on Network using Multicast or Broadcast protocol.

EZ to do, so it should stay EZ to use.

I used LWT because it is cool and compatible with others libs (Async/EIO)

## Usage

To write.

## Quick demo

```sh
dune exec bin/demo.exe 3000
```
